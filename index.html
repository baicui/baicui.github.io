<h2>Bio Sketch</h2>
<p>Bai Cui is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. 
His research focuses on the applications of control and optimization techniques in power and energy systems to improve system security, 
economic efficiency, and sustainability. 
Bai received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2011, 
B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2011, and his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2018. 
Prior to joining ISU, he was a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and a postdoctoral appointee at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
